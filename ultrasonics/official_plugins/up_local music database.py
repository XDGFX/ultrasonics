"""
up_local music database

Allows for compatibility between non-local services (Spotify, Deezer), and local services (.m3u playlists, Plex).
Creates a database of all your music, and uses fuzzy tags matching to match a song from songs_dics with a physical file.
The file path will be added to the songs_dict entry if it is found locally.
Existing locations are left untouched.
